# Pisek ⏳

Tool for developing tasks for programming competitions.

## Why use pisek?

- **Fast**
    - **Caching** — Results from previous runs are cached and only the changes are tested.
    - **Parallelism** — Pisek runs tests in parallel to speed up task testing.
- **Versatile**
    - **Many programming languages** — Among them C, C++, Java, Bash, Python and Rust. Additionally,
    you can build your programs with a Makefile.
    - **Supports various program interfaces** — We aim to support many interfaces
    used across different contests. If you have a program interface you would like us
    to support, please [create an issue](https://github.com/piskoviste/pisek/issues/new?template=new_program_type.md).
    - **Open-data and closed-data tasks** — Pisek supports the preparation of both open-data tasks
    (where contestants get the input) and closed-data tasks (where contestants submit their code). 
- **Customizable**
    - You can set defaults for configurations across all tasks in your organization.
