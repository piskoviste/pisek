# Pisek ⏳

Tool for developing tasks for programming competitions.

## Why use pisek?

- **Fast**
    - **Caching** — Result from previous runs are cached and only things that have changed are tested.
    - **Parallelism** — Pisek tests in parallel to speed up task testing.
- **Versatile**
    - **Many programming languages** — Among them C, C++, Java, Bash, Python and Rust. Additionally,
    you can build your programs with a Makefile.
    - **Supports various program interfaces** — We aim to support many interfaces
    used across different contests. If you have a program interface you would like us
    to support, please [create an issue]().
    - **Open-data and closed-data tasks** — Pisek supports both preparation of open-data tasks
    (where contestants gets the input) and closed-data tasks (where contestant submits the solution). 
- **Customizable**
    - You can set defaults for configurations across all tasks in your organization.
