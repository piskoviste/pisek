# Tests

The solutions are judged on *tests* (groups of *testcases*) each usually representing
additional restriction(s) on the task statement. Each test is worth a certain number of points,
which are awarded for solving all testcases in the test.

## Testcases

The testcases can be of three kinds:

- *static* — Both the input and the output is created as a file by the task author.
- *mixed* — The input is written by the task author, and the correct output is generated by the primary solution.
- *generated* — The input is generated by the generator, the correct output by the primary solution.

For interactive tasks, we only have static and generated testcases, as there are no outputs.

Pisek distinguishes the kind of a testcase automatically. The static and mixed
testcases have an input (`.in` file) in the [`static_subdir`](../config-docs.md)
directory. If a `.out` file with matching name is also there, the testcase is
static. Otherwise, it's mixed. The list of the generated inputs is given by the
generator (either by the generator itself or its interface).
